The social coding circle is a unique circle, such that it funds
some external technological projects to Giveth, yet ones that are
synergetic that would ultimately be useful. The projects are funded
using Giveth Milestones and the [RewardDAO](https://medium.com/giveth/how-rewarddao-works-aka-what-are-points-7388f70269a).

The goal for some of these projects is that there can potentially
be integration points between Givethâ€™s dapp or they may be useful
for managing Decentralized Altruistic Communities (DACs).
Others are simply fun open source projects that make the world a better place.

## EthKan

Status: Active

Lead: Needs a new leader but @oz_at_giveth:matrix.org and @xet7:matrix.org can mentor and @kingflurkel:matrix.org

Description: Imagine if each card on your project board was a contract that accepted ethereum.

Tasks: 
- Work with xet7 to create  EthKan integration web3js calls into Wekan https://wekan.github.io. Integrations would work work similarly like existing Wekan-Gogs integration https://github.com/wekan/wekan-gogs .
- Use contract-demo-ui as example of how to call EthKan contract (located in ethkan-contracts repo).
